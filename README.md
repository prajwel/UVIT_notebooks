# UVIT notebooks

I am trying to compile a few Jupyter notebooks related to UVIT analysis. I hope that it may be helpful. 

## 1. Search your target among existing UVIT pointings 
The first one deals with how to search your source of interest among the already observed list of targets. A list has been compiled with Observation IDs and pointing coordinates in RA and DEC. This list can be accessed at https://github.com/prajwel/UVIT_notebooks/blob/main/UVIT_pointings.txt (I will try to keep the list updated).

The Jupyter notebook with the python script to do the search can be found at https://github.com/prajwel/UVIT_notebooks/blob/main/search_your_target_among_existing_UVIT_pointings.ipynb.
