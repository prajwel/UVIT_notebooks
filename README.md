# UVIT notebooks

I am trying to compile a few Jupyter notebooks related to UVIT analysis. I hope that it may be helpful. Click on "Launch binder" badge below to load the notebooks present in this repository for an online interactive analysis.

## 1. Search your target among existing UVIT pointings 
The first one deals with how to search your source of interest among the already observed list of targets. A list has been compiled with Observation IDs and pointing coordinates in RA and DEC. This list can be accessed at [UVIT_pointings.txt](\UVIT_pointings.txt) (I will try to keep the list updated). The Jupyter notebook with the python script to do the search can be found at [notebook1_search_your_target_among_existing_UVIT_pointings.ipynb](/notebook1_search_your_target_among_existing_UVIT_pointings.ipynb).

## 2. Can UVIT observe your field of interest? Find out with CanUVIT!
If your field of interest is not already observed by UVIT in the desired filters/gratings, you can submit a new AstroSat proposal. But you should first check if UVIT can safely observe your field. The notebook [notebook2_UVIT_VIS_UV_safety_check.ipynb](\notebook2_UVIT_VIS_UV_safety_check.ipynb) shows how to do this. 

*More notebooks will be added soon....*
